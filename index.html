				<p>More and more people decide to live their life differently, creating their own job, based on their passions and skills, spending time building something on their own and travelling the world to feel and experience new sensations.</p>
				<p>The increasing complexity and multiplication of possibilities and questions around co-working space, incubators, accelerators, business models, start-ups, funding, scaling, growth hacking and more, as well as the concentration of experiences around leisure today, led us to the creation of our unique services.</p>
				<p>We are providing life-changing experience on Entrepreneurship. Guiding students, entrepreneurs, freelancers, managers and angels through this new industry, with drive and passion. We offer fully customised experiences with great value for anybody inspired by the new economy.</p>
